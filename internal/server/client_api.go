// expiry (watchdogs arrive in a later stage — see the design doc's staging
// section), and the store's leases.expires_at column is written with an
// internal default that nothing reads yet. Advertising a lease_ttl_seconds
// knob on the wire that silently did nothing was worse than not having the

// production"), and since there is no preemption, a big number buys nothing
// a small one does not — it only makes every later submitter bid higher.

// asked for 500 is never quietly given 10 and left believing otherwise.
