// autoRecoveryWindow and autoRecoveryLimit are the flap guard: a device may
// come back on its own at most autoRecoveryLimit times inside a sliding
// autoRecoveryWindow, after which it waits for a human.
//
// The point is not to ration recoveries — a fleet rolling a new worker image
// recovers every device once and never trips this. It is that a device which
// quarantines, clears, and quarantines again is describing a real problem
// (a card resetting, a driver wedging, a worker crash-looping), and a system
// that silently keeps putting it back hides exactly the signal an operator
// needs. Three in an hour is chosen to sit well above ordinary maintenance
// — even a bad rolling restart touches a device once or twice — and well
// below "nobody will ever notice".
//
// The window slides rather than latching: once the recorded recoveries age
// out, the device is eligible again. A latch would need a second explicit
// human action to release (a clear does not obviously mean "and re-arm
// auto-recovery"), and a device that flapped at 3am and has been healthy
// since should not still be barred at noon.

// Recovery is one device returned to the pool by AutoRecover, and the
// quarantine reason it was cleared FROM. The reason travels back because the
// event this feeds — an operator asking "why is this device back?" — needs
// to name what the device was out for, and by the time the caller looks, the
// row no longer says (the reason is cleared with the quarantine it explains).

// AutoRecover returns this worker's quarantined devices to the pool when the
// proof it presented at registration answers what they were quarantined for.
//
// It is the cheap sibling of restoreRebootedDevicesLocked (see store.go),
// which does the same job on the strength of a changed boot ID. The two
// answer the identical question — "can anything from the interrupted job
// still be holding this device?" — and clear the identical set of causes
// (rebootClearableReasons); they differ only in what constitutes the proof.
// A reboot proves it by destroying every process on the machine, which costs
// minutes and a full restart of everything the host runs. A container restart
// proves it by destroying the PID namespace the jobs lived in, and a host
// worker proves it by looking. See model.RecoveryProof.
//
// What is deliberately NOT here:
//
//   - fault. A self-reported hardware problem is not answered by "no
//     processes are running": the probe that reported it tested something
//     this proof does not. It is excluded by rebootClearableReasons, the
//     same list and the same reasoning the reboot path uses.
//   - an unrecorded cause (an empty quarantine_reason). Guessing "probably a
//     lost worker" about a device quarantined before that column existed is
//     the one direction that can hand out bad hardware.
//   - a device with a live lease. Nothing may contradict the lease table —
//     the rule ClearDevice enforces against an operator is enforced here
//     against a proof.
//
// It runs as its own transaction, after UpsertWorker rather than inside it,
// and that ordering is required: UpsertWorker's reap pass is what quarantines
// a device whose worker re-registered with a job in flight, so a recovery
// pass folded into it would either run before the quarantine it exists to
// answer or have to be threaded through the middle of a function that is
// already the most safety-critical one in this package. Between the two calls
// the device is simply still quarantined, which nothing schedules onto, so
// the window is not observable.
